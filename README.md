# test
* Build a working review site for users based on Reactjs, React Context , React Hooks and Graphql. * Use create-react-app. * Use https://graphcms.com/ (which Graphql based) for backend api. * For look and feel, you will use - https://baseweb.design/getting-started/usage/ . to make it look good. You have ready-made UI pieces like https://baseweb.design/components/card/ , https://baseweb.design/components/modal/ , https://baseweb.design/components/input/ * You will make this site live on now.sh (https://zeit.co/now) -  https://zeit.co/guides/deploying-react-with-now-cra * After you are done with this assignment, you will send us the link of the source code on github and the link of live site on now.sh   The site itself is very simple - Think of it like Airbnb for reviews. - There are two kinds of users: reviewers and admins. - reviewer can sign up using username + password - both reviewer and admin can login to the site using username/password.   - reviewer can post a review of a product. - Admin approves review. Review CANNOT be seen on site until it is approved. - on front page of site, all reviews (that have been approved by admin) get listed. Remember to do this in a paginated way. - reviewer has a dashboard, where he can see reviews written by him and also post new reviews. - admin has dashboard - where he can see reviews written by everyone and do approval and reject.   - Review has 3 primary fields: title, body, image . This gets saved through Graphql in Graphcms. - Review has 3 automatic fields: views (how many times this review has been viewed/clicked), likes (how many times this review has been liked) and author (the reviwer who has created this review). This gets saved through Graphql in Graphcms. - make it look good! You have ready-made UI pieces like https://baseweb.design/components/card/ , https://baseweb.design/components/modal/ , https://baseweb.design/components/input/   Remember that you have to use React Context (versus Redux) and Hooks (versus classes). see here - https://medium.com/simply/state-management-with-react-hooks-and-context-api-at-10-lines-of-code-baf6be8302c Hint: in case you need more help, do this course - https://www.udemy.com/modern-react/
